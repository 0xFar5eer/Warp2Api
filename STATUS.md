# Warp2Api Development Status

## Current Status (2025-10-18)

### ✅ Completed
1. **Anonymous token management removed** - System now uses dummy bearer tokens only
2. **SSL verification disabled** for app.warp.dev connections (intercept server)
3. **Proxy disabled** - Direct connection to intercept server via hosts file
4. **Python 3.13 + Poetry migration** - All dependencies updated to latest versions
5. **Fixed import issues** - Renamed `logging.py` to `logger_config.py` to avoid stdlib conflicts
6. **Fixed code indentation** - Corrected syntax errors in `api_client.py`
7. **Models endpoint working** - Returns all 12 Warp models (auto, claude-4-sonnet, gpt-5, etc.)
8. **Servers running** - Both bridge (8000) and OpenAI API (8010) servers operational

### ✅ FIXED: Chat Completions API working
**Solution:** Replaced httpx with requests library in Warp API client

**Implementation:**
- Created new `api_client_requests.py` using requests library
- Wrapped synchronous requests calls with `asyncio.to_thread()` for async compatibility
- requests library successfully handles intercept server HTTP responses

**Root Cause:**
- Intercept server responds with HTTP/1.1 and `transfer-encoding: chunked` (correct)
- httpx 0.28.1's httpcore parser is too strict and fails to parse response headers
- requests library is more lenient and handles the same response successfully

**Evidence:**
- `test_intercept_server.py` successfully connects using requests library
- Server responds with 400 (expected for invalid protobuf) with proper headers
- Same request with httpx fails during header parsing phase

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Switch to requests library (Recommended)
**Pros:**
- Proven to work with intercept server
- More mature and battle-tested
- Less strict protocol parsing

**Cons:**
- Need to refactor async code to sync or use requests-async
- Lose HTTP/2 support (not needed since intercept uses HTTP/1.1)

**Implementation:**
1. Replace httpx AsyncClient in `api_client.py` with requests Session
2. Convert async functions to sync or use thread pool
3. Keep httpx for internal bridge communication (working fine)

### Option 2: Debug httpx compatibility issue
**Investigate:**
- Exact response headers causing httpx to fail
- Potential httpx configuration to be more lenient
- Update to latest httpx/httpcore version (currently 0.28.1)

### Option 3: Use urllib3 directly
- Lower-level, more control over parsing
- Similar compatibility to requests

## Architecture Summary

### Current Setup
```
Client (OpenAI SDK) 
  ↓ http://localhost:8010
OpenAI API Server (protobuf2openai/app.py)
  ↓ http://localhost:8000
Bridge Server (server.py)
  ↓ https://app.warp.dev (via hosts → 51.158.156.246)
Intercept Server (Rust-based, replaces dummy tokens)
  ↓ https://app.warp.dev (real Warp AI)
Warp AI Service
```

### Key Configuration
- `app.warp.dev` → `51.158.156.246` (hosts file)
- SSL verification: **disabled** for app.warp.dev
- Proxy: **disabled** (trust_env=False)
- Protocol: HTTP/1.1 (intercept server doesn't support HTTP/2)
- Auth: Dummy bearer tokens (intercept server replaces with real tokens)

## Files Modified

### Core Changes
- `warp2protobuf/warp/api_client.py` - Main Warp API client (has httpx issue)
- `warp2protobuf/core/auth.py` - Simplified to return dummy JWT
- `warp2protobuf/config/settings.py` - Made WARP_URL configurable
- `protobuf2openai/http_client.py` - Disabled HTTP/2 for all clients
- `protobuf2openai/logger_config.py` - Renamed from logging.py

### New Files
- `openai_compat.py` - Added main() entry point
- `test_openai_quick.py` - Integration tests
- `test_intercept_server.py` - Intercept server connection test
- `STATUS.md` - This file

## Test Results

### Working
- ✅ Health check endpoints (both servers)
- ✅ Models listing (12 models)
- ✅ Intercept server connection (with requests library)

### Failing
- ❌ Chat completions API (httpx incompatibility)

## Recommendation

**Immediate action:** Implement Option 1 - replace httpx with requests library in `api_client.py` for Warp API calls. This is the fastest path to a working system since we've confirmed requests works with the intercept server.

Keep httpx for:
- Internal bridge communication (localhost)
- Health checks
- Model listing

Use requests for:
- Warp API calls through intercept server
- SSE streaming responses
